# Agent Guidelines

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS check files before editing** - View the actual file content before making any changes
2. **ALWAYS verify before responding** - Read all relevant files before giving analysis or answering questions  
3. **NEVER assume file contents** - Don't guess what code looks like, read it first
4. **NEVER give partial analysis** - When asked about test coverage, read ALL test files first
5. **Verify search results** - After grep/find, view actual files to confirm context
